# Product Guidelines

## Visual Identity
- **Neon Glow & High Contrast:** The game utilizes a high-contrast synthwave aesthetic. Key elements like the ball, paddle, and bricks should feature glowing "neon" outlines against dark, often grid-patterned or deep-space backgrounds.
- **Vibrant Palette:** Use a palette of electric pinks, cyans, and purples to maintain the synthwave feel.

## UI & Messaging
- **Retro-Themed UI:** The user interface should employ pixelated or retro-style fonts.
- **Visual Effects:** Consider implementing a subtle CRT scanline overlay or "glitch" effects to enhance the retro arcade immersion.
- **Clarity:** Despite the retro feel, critical information like score, health, and current level should be easily readable at a glance.

## Gameplay Feel
- **Crisp Physics:** Bounces should feel sharp and predictable, maintaining the "classic" feel.
- **Satisfying Impact:** Use visual and audio cues to make every brick destruction feel rewarding.
